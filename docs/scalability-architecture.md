# Database Scalability Architecture - 10x Load Design

## **Backend Performance Philosophy**
- **Reliability > Features > Convenience**
- **Target**: 99.9% uptime, <100ms query response, handle 10x current load
- **Approach**: Conservative on data, aggressive on optimization

## **Current Load Assumptions**
- **Current**: ~100 concurrent users, ~1000 orders/day
- **Target 10x**: ~1000 concurrent users, ~10,000 orders/day
- **Peak Load**: ~2000 concurrent during promotions

## **1. Database Scaling Strategy**

### **Horizontal Scaling (Primary Strategy)**

```yaml
Read Replicas Architecture:
  Primary (Write): 1 master database
  Read Replicas: 3 read-only replicas
  Load Distribution:
    - Writes: Primary only
    - Reads: Round-robin across replicas
    - Analytics: Dedicated analytics replica
```

### **Connection Pooling**

```yaml
PgBouncer Configuration:
  Pool Size: 100 connections per instance
  Pool Mode: Transaction pooling
  Max Client Connections: 1000
  
Connection Distribution:
  Primary: 30 connections (writes)
  Read Replica 1: 25 connections (product searches)
  Read Replica 2: 25 connections (order queries)
  Read Replica 3: 20 connections (analytics)
```

### **Database Sharding (Future Phase)**

```yaml
Sharding Strategy:
  Shard Key: shop_id (natural business boundary)
  Shard Distribution:
    - Shard 1: shops 1-1000
    - Shard 2: shops 1001-2000
    - Shard 3: shops 2001-3000
  
Cross-Shard Queries:
  - Customer orders: Query aggregation layer
  - Global search: Search service (Elasticsearch)
```

## **2. Caching Strategy**

### **Redis Cache Layers**

```yaml
L1 Cache - Application Level:
  Duration: 5 minutes
  Data: Product listings, shop info
  
L2 Cache - Database Query Cache:
  Duration: 15 minutes
  Data: Complex aggregations, search results
  
L3 Cache - CDN Level:
  Duration: 1 hour
  Data: Product images, static content
```

### **Cache Invalidation**

```yaml
Strategies:
  Write-Through: Orders, payments (consistency critical)
  Write-Behind: Analytics, view counts (eventual consistency OK)
  Cache-Aside: Product searches, listings
  
Invalidation Triggers:
  - Product updates: Clear product cache
  - Order status changes: Clear order cache
  - Shop updates: Clear shop cache
```

## **3. Query Optimization**

### **Materialized Views**

```sql
-- Pre-calculated shop performance metrics
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW shop_analytics AS
SELECT 
  s.id,
  s.name,
  COUNT(DISTINCT o.id) as total_orders,
  AVG(o.total_amount) as avg_order_value,
  AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (o.delivered_at - o.created_at))) as avg_fulfillment_time,
  AVG(rating) as avg_rating
FROM shops s
LEFT JOIN order_items oi ON s.id = oi.shop_id
LEFT JOIN orders o ON oi.order_id = o.id
WHERE o.status = 'DELIVERED'
GROUP BY s.id, s.name;

-- Refresh every hour
SELECT cron.schedule('refresh-shop-analytics', '0 * * * *', 'REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW shop_analytics;');
```

### **Partitioning Strategy**

```sql
-- Partition orders by month for historical data
CREATE TABLE orders_2024_01 PARTITION OF orders
FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2024-02-01');

CREATE TABLE orders_2024_02 PARTITION OF orders
FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-02-01') TO ('2024-03-01');

-- Automatic partition creation
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION create_monthly_partition()
RETURNS void AS $$
DECLARE
  start_date date;
  end_date date;
  partition_name text;
BEGIN
  start_date := date_trunc('month', current_date + interval '1 month');
  end_date := start_date + interval '1 month';
  partition_name := 'orders_' || to_char(start_date, 'YYYY_MM');
  
  EXECUTE format('CREATE TABLE %I PARTITION OF orders FOR VALUES FROM (%L) TO (%L)',
    partition_name, start_date, end_date);
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Schedule monthly partition creation
SELECT cron.schedule('create-partition', '0 0 1 * *', 'SELECT create_monthly_partition();');
```

## **4. Monitoring & Alerting**

### **Performance Metrics**

```yaml
Database Metrics:
  - Connection count (alert > 80% of max)
  - Query response time (alert > 100ms average)
  - Replication lag (alert > 1 second)
  - Cache hit ratio (alert < 90%)
  - Disk usage (alert > 80%)

Application Metrics:
  - Request latency (p95 < 200ms)
  - Error rate (< 0.1%)
  - Throughput (requests/second)
  - Active user count
```

### **Health Checks**

```sql
-- Database health check query
SELECT 
  'connections' as metric,
  (SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity) as current_value,
  100 as max_value,
  case when (SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity) > 80 then 'CRITICAL' else 'OK' end as status
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'replication_lag' as metric,
  (SELECT extract(epoch from (now() - pg_last_xact_replay_timestamp()))) as current_value,
  1 as max_value,
  case when (SELECT extract(epoch from (now() - pg_last_xact_replay_timestamp()))) > 1 then 'CRITICAL' else 'OK' end as status;
```

## **5. Backup & Recovery**

### **Backup Strategy**

```yaml
Point-in-Time Recovery:
  WAL archiving: Continuous
  Full backup: Daily at 2 AM
  Retention: 30 days
  
Cross-Region Backup:
  Primary region: Asia-Pacific
  Backup region: US-West
  Sync frequency: Every 6 hours
  
Recovery Time Objectives:
  RTO: < 15 minutes (automated failover)
  RPO: < 5 minutes (acceptable data loss)
```

### **Disaster Recovery**

```yaml
Failover Scenarios:
  1. Primary database failure:
     - Promote read replica to primary
     - Update connection strings
     - Redirect traffic
     
  2. Region failure:
     - Switch to backup region
     - Restore from latest backup
     - Acceptable downtime: < 1 hour
```

## **6. Migration Strategy**

### **Zero-Downtime Migration**

```yaml
Phase 1: Dual Write
  - Write to both old and new schema
  - Read from old schema
  - Validate data consistency
  
Phase 2: Gradual Read Migration
  - Migrate read queries by percentage
  - Monitor performance metrics
  - Rollback capability maintained
  
Phase 3: Full Migration
  - Switch all reads to new schema
  - Stop writes to old schema
  - Drop old tables after validation
```

## **7. Performance Benchmarks**

### **Load Testing Targets**

```yaml
Concurrent Users: 1000
Average Response Time: < 100ms
95th Percentile: < 200ms
99th Percentile: < 500ms
Error Rate: < 0.1%

Database Connections:
  Max: 500 concurrent
  Average: 200 concurrent
  Connection acquisition: < 10ms
```

### **Stress Testing Scenarios**

```yaml
Scenario 1: Product Search Peak
  - 2000 concurrent product searches
  - Complex filtering queries
  - Target: < 150ms response time
  
Scenario 2: Order Rush Hour
  - 500 concurrent order placements
  - Payment processing
  - Target: < 300ms end-to-end
  
Scenario 3: Vendor Dashboard Load
  - 200 vendors viewing orders simultaneously
  - Real-time updates
  - Target: < 100ms query time
```

## **8. Cost Optimization**

### **Resource Allocation**

```yaml
Production Environment:
  Primary DB: 8 CPU, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD
  Read Replicas: 4 CPU, 16GB RAM each
  Redis Cache: 2 CPU, 8GB RAM
  
Estimated Monthly Cost:
  Database: $800/month
  Caching: $200/month
  Monitoring: $100/month
  Total: $1100/month (vs $5000 for over-provisioning)
```
